### Abstarct
This project can be used by the pathologist to analyse the images of the human tissues to find the tumourous elements. If the user clicks on the image, we highlight all the pixels of the image which have distance <= distance range bar. In addition to it, We show all the clicked pixels with their corresponding checked radio buttons. Radio buttons can be checked/unchecked according to the need. Unchecking will undo all the hightlights corresponding to that pixel. Checking of the radio button across a particular pixel will lead to highlight all the appropriate pixels again. Pathologist can perform checking/unchecking any number of times.
